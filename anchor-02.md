2.  The customer selects an asset to deposit and the wallet finds an anchor (clients   could also chose the specific anchor)
3.  Once the wallet authenticates with the anchor, the customer begins entering their KYC and transaction information requested by the anchor
4.  The wallet provides instructions, and the customer deposits real fiat currency(Naira) with the anchor (e.g. makes a bank transfer)

Asset Exchanges ðŸ”—
### Exchange between off-chain and on-chain non equivalent assets like NGN <> USDC

#### To support the exchange of non-equivalent assets using this protocol, the anchor must allow users to select the off-chain asset they would like to provide or receive (for deposit and withdrawal, respectively) within the anchor's interactive flow. The anchor should then display an exchange rate to the user in addition to any fees charged for facilitating the transaction. Whether this exchange rate is binding or an estimate is up to the anchor, but this distinction must be communicated to the user.
